# Creating a New Book
This document will guide you through the process of creating a new book. 

## Background to Publishing on Hornbill Docs
In order to understand the process of creating a new book, its important to understand conceptually what the Hornbill Documentation system is.  Fundamentally, the Hornbill Docs platform is a documentation publishing system, specifically designed for publishing official Hornbill documentation to the [docs.hornbill.com](https://docs.hornbill.com) website. 

Hornbill's documentation system borrows the basic concepts of physical paper book publishing, something that is very familiar to most of us, should so should be easy to understand and relate to.  We consider the Hornbill documentation site to be our "public library" of documents, and just like a physical library, our individual units of documentation are broken down into "books", where each book is a collection of one or more individual articles plus a table of contents that organizes those articles into a structure, much like chapters and a table of contents does in a traditional paper book. 

Part of the HDocs system is a taxonomy, this you can think of in library terms like the classifications and areas of teh library (literature, physics, computer science, fiction etc...), which is used to take a collection of books and organize them into logical, easily navigable document library.   

The Hornbill Docs team play the role of the "publisher" making sure that book titles are relevant, well organized, not duplicating existing content, the taxonomy makes sense, the compiled library searchable and easily accessible by the intended audience.

## Do We Really Need A New Book?
Before creating a new book, we need to decide if a new book is actually needed in the first place.  Unlike a physical library with paper books, the Hornbill Docs system uses digital medium making it very easy to add/update existing books content.  In fact, most books published on the Hornbill Documentation site are published as open source on GitHup so anyone that wishes to contribute can follow the Simple or Complex edits work flows in order to do that. 

The reason why this question needs to be asked right up front is because the Hornbill Docs team will be quite selective about what new books it will accept for publication on the [Hornbill Documentation Web Site](https://docs.hornbill.com).  This is because, just like a publisher of physical books, the Hornbill Docs team will want to maintain library quality, relevance and consistency of each book in the library.  Any new books will need to deliver stand-alone value, will not substantially or in part, duplicate existing content, and should be generally additive to the body of knowledge in he Hornbill library. The book will need to fit the right taxonomy and should should cover topic(s) that are not already covered by existing documentation. 

## A New Book Proposal
The starting point for any new book on the Hornbill Docs platform will be the **New Book Proposal** which is a formal request into the Hornbill Docs team outlining the information about the book that should be created.  Once you log into the Hornbill documentation site, you will find an option under the "Contributing" menu to Request or Propose a new book. Each option will present you with a series of questions to help the Hornbill Docs team evaluate your request. Typically Customers or other users would "Request" a new book be created to cover the topic(s) they feel are not already covered in other documents.  A proposal on the other hand would come from a subject matter expert who will create the book content. 

When proposing a new book to be published, the following mandatory information is required: -

- Book Title
  - The most important attribute of a book, the title is what will appear in the master index, search results and other key areas of the documentation system. The book title must be meaningful, relevant and fit within the overall library index structure
- Synopsys
  - Just as important as the title, 1-5 paragraphs setting out the purpose and topics for the book to cover
- Audience
  - Must define the target audience in accordance to the Hornbill Docs taxonomy specification
- Table of Contents (optional)
  - Ideally this would be useful at proposal stage but, understand its often not possible. 

Once the Book has boon proposed, the Hornbill Doc's team will review and either accept the proposal or feedback what needs to be changed in order to achieve acceptance.

## Writing a Book for Hornbill Docs
We recognize that not everyone is an aspiring author or technical writer, and is often the case, those who are subject matter experts are not writers, and probably do not enjoy the process of writing documentation. We can look at the writing process on a book-by-book basis to figure out the best way to go about writing any given book. The Hornbill Docs team can take on the writing the book, working with individual Subject Manager Expert(s) to extract and capture knowledge, or we can use external writers, independent subject matter experts, or any combination of those things. If you want to write a book but do not have the writing shops, thats also ok, write what you can and the Hornbill Docs team can take that writing and expand, develop and evolve the content.  The main gaol always is to capture valuable content, and ensure that we create the very best quality documentation we can that will help our customers, partners and teams at Hornbill.

With any contributions, the Hornbill Docs team will always run content through a process which includes copy-editing, fact verification and copy-writing to ensure information is high quality, unambiguous and makes sense to the intended audience.
