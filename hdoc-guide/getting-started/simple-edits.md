# Simple Edits Workflow

If you wish to make simple edits, like spelling/grammar corrections or adding/removing some text, you can achieve this with only a web browser and without the need to install special tools or libraries.  The only requirement is, you have a personal or company GitHub account. 

## Pre-requisites 
- A personal or work GitHub account
- A web browser, connected to the internet

## GitHub

GitHub is an online source code and community projects website, primarily used for Open Source projects.  Hornbill maintains a GitHub account which is used for our documentation.  Most documents on our Hornbill Docs site are made available as a public repository on our GitHub account.  

You will be unable to contribute to Hornbill's documentation unless you have a personal GitHub account. If you do not have a personal GitHub account you can create one for free here: [Join GitHub for Free](https://github.com/join). Once you have created a GitHub account, you can open the Hornbill-Docs home page and see the Hornbill Docs GitHub account here [Hornbill-Docs](https://github.com/Hornbill-Docs).

You can then follow the instructions below to make and submit edits for consideration. 

## Using GitHub Online only

Minor edits are easy to do just by using GitHub and its basic editing and markdown preview capabilities. To make an edit to an existing document follow the steps below. 

1. Log into your GitHub account
2. Search for, or browse to the [Hornbill-Docs](https://github.com/Hornbill-Docs) page.
3. Click on the ***Repositories*** tab, and find the document you wish to contribute to, then click on it to view its home page.
4. At the top-right of the page you should see an option to *Fork*, choose that option, and accept the defaults, it will create a copy of the HDocBook source code under your account, and GitHub will automatically navigate you to the Home Page of the newly forked repo. 
5. You can now browse the files in the repo and click on individual .md file(s) you wish to edit. You can also edit the hdocbook.json file to add/re-organize the left navigation tree. 
6. Once you open the file you want to edit, you can choose the edit option in GitHub, and edit the markdown text as required. 
7. Each time you complete your edits on a file, you will be asked to commit the changes, providing a message for the repo/reviewer of your changes.  Please note, at this point you are only committing changes to your local repo copy, not the master documentation. 
8. Once you have edited all of the files you wish to edit, you can create a Pull Request. Select the "Pull Requests" tab, and in that view, press the "New Pull Request" button. 
9. Review the changes and make sure you are happy with them, then press the "Create Pull Request" button
10. Confirm by pressing the "Create pull request" button

::: important
You will notice that the markdown content can be previewed in GitHub. While the content is rendered, and while both GitHub and Hornbill Docs support Markdown, GitHub only support the basic CommonMark specification, so features such a this info panel for example, will not appear on GitHub but will appear on Hornbill Docs when published.

Thats it, your pull requests have been submitted to the Hornbill Docs team and they will review and accept/reject in due course.
