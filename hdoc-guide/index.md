## Hornbill Docs Overview
The Hornbill Docs system is a complete end-to-end solution for creating and publishing documentation to 
Hornbill Docs https://docs.hornbill.com/ in order that our customers, partners and others can browse and 
search our published documentation. 

Sharing your expertise with others on Hornbill Docs helps everyone in our community achieve more. Use 
the information in this guide to learn how to make updates to an existing published article, or publish 
new content to Hornbill Docs.

Many of the documents available on Hornbill Docs are published as open source projects, hosted on 
GitHub. Documents that are published on GitHub can be forked by anyone wishing to contribute to Hornbill's 
documenting, can make edits/additions to the content and submit a pull request to the Hornbill Docs team 
for review, and inclusion in future revisions of the published documentation.  This open-source approach 
improves communication and facilitates better knowledge sharing, helping product product and content 
teams, and customers have access to the collective knowledge.  Contribution to Hornbill's documentation 
is moderated, ensuring content meets our quality and inclusion standards.  

The documentation system is modeled around the notion of a Library of Documents, each document is called
 a ''Book'', and we call the collection of published books the ''Library''.  There is one global library 
 for all published books that are presented on Hornbill's documentation web site (https://docs.hornbill.com/). 
You can think of the Hornbill Docs system as conceptually representative of a traditional book library, where 
a community (our customers, partners and team members) all have access to a Public Library (the document
web site), with all of the Books in that library being organized and categorized into different sections
and and locations within the library for accessibility. 

Books contain textual content, pictures, downloadable assets, embedded video or any other web based 
resources you would typically find in a we application, and book content can be created in multiple 
languages where required.

Books can be created and authored by Hornbill's Documentation Team. However, most books are created and 
published as open source to facilitate contributions by our partners, customers and other interested 
parties. Open Source Books are available in source code format, published on GitHub, making it possible 
for anyone to fork the Book into their own GitHub account, make changes and submit a pull request to 
Hornbill's documentation team for review and inclusion in the officially published documents.
