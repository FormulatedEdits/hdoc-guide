Hornbill Docs is build substantially using open source tools and has drawn inspiration, guidance and ideas from numerous systems, projects and information made generally available to the open-source community.  The Hornbill Docs project is standing on the shoulders of giants, the many individuals, teams and organizations who have contributed time, resources and knowhow to open-source projects to the benefit of everyone.  We would like to attribute this project to the projects, individuals and organizations named below who we have drawn inspiration, knowhow and software from: -

* Microsoft Learn - a world-class project showing how to embrace and open source philosophy to produce and outstanding documentation system, Hornbill Docs has drawn huge inspiration from this project, as well as made use of various open-source artifacts that Microsoft have made available to the community under liberal licensing agreements. 
* Vitepress - a really nice "instant up and running" example of how to create a static documentation site using markdown and Node.js with a live-edit environment. Although Vitepress turned out not to be the right solution to build Hornbill Docs on, The initial inspiration, and kickstart for Hornbill Docs began using this project. 
* GitHub - a great source code control, ecosystem and tooling that makes community engagement and therefore external contribution to Hornbill Docs at scale possible. 
* Node.js - when development workflows are involved, Node.js and its many projects, libraries and tools are pretty amazing
* markdown-it
* highlight.js
* Vue.js
* Express.js 
* others to follow... 

We have been using MediaWiki [Hornbill Wiki](https://wiki.hornbill.com) for a very long time, but as our product and our customers and partner eco systems have grown, the Hornbill Docs project will be the foundation and standard for our documentation strategy.
